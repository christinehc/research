# Research

Personal data analysis tools for my own (scientific) research.

* **xps-plot**: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) fitting suite created as a Q.O.L. improvement for surface characterization in the Velian research group at UW.  Primarily designed for use with P 2p HR XPS signal fitting.  Expansion to N 1s and other elements may occur if there is enough interest.
* **xrd-plot**: Super old, outdated functions written for previous XRD work.
