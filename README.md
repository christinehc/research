# Research

Personal data analysis tools for my own (scientific) research.

* **xps-plot**: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) fitting suite created as a Q.O.L. improvement for surface characterization in the Velian research group at UW.  Primarily designed for use with P 2p HR XPS signal fitting.  Expansion to N 1s and other elements may occur if there is enough interest.
* **xrd-plot**: Super old, outdated functions written for previous XRD work.

## To use **xps-plot**:

1. Download the [xps-plot.zip](https://github.com/christinehc/research/raw/master/xps-plot/xps-plot.zip) file. The contents include 3 files:
  * how_to_xps_fit.ipynb
  * xpsfit.py
  * xpstools.py
2. Save the contents of the file to a local folder on your computer. _All three files must be moved to the same folder to work properly._
3. Open **how_to_xps_fit.ipynb** and follow the instructions therein.

### OR (not recommended unless you know what you're doing)

1. Fork/clone this repository.
2. Open **how_to_xps_fit.ipynb** and follow the instructions therein.
